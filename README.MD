Send your links to Buffer-App when reading on the Pocket Web-UI (formerly: Read-it-later).

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Pocket (formerly: Read-it-later) is a service for marking articles on the web to read them later. Buffer is a service to schedule your posts to your social-media-accounts easily (e.g. to Twitter).

But there is no way to share your links to buffer (or any other social-media-services) right from the Pocket-Web-User-Interface. Thats exactly what this extension does.

It grabs the arcticle-title and article-url and sends it to the buffer-API, opens a new tab and shows you the buffer-dialog you are already used to.

This is really the ultra-first version 0.001. If something doesn't work or you have suggestions let me know.

ROADMAP:
- make an overlay over the article like the original buffer-extension (no new tabs)
- make compatible to Chrome < v20 (due to "onMessage"-events currently)
- integrate other social-services (facebook, twitter) directly
- ...
